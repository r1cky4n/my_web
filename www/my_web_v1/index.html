                    I met a traveller from an antique land <br>
                    Who said: 'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
                    Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br>
                    Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
                    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
                    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
                    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
                    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.<br>
                    And on the pedestal these words appear --<br>
                    "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
                    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
                    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
                    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
                    The lone and level sands stretch far away.'<br>

                    But there is more too engineering that just the physical and concrete. We are the creators of
                    the future, so our actions today not only affect the lives of those around us, but also the lives
                    of those who will succeed us. We must design and build a world that reflects the best in humanity,
                    and pass down a sustainable legacy that can grow and evolve with the needs of the times.

                    <br><br>

                    With this in mind, I want to help usher in the future. I am a hardware engineer
                    at a stealth startup aiming to democratize hardware design for the masses. We are building a modular
                    and customizable hardware and software solution that allows for the rapid bring-up of ASIC-like designs
                    without the multi-million dollar costs or year-long design schedules. As the Lead Digital Design Engineer,
                    it is my responsibility to create a system that is scalable, accessible, and resilient. Our product will ease
                    the development of everything from small form-factor wearables such as biometric sensor rings to mission
                    critical control systems like autonomous driving vehicle hardware arrays. There is still a lot of work ahead of us,
                    but the challenge is exciting and fun.

                <div class="subpage">
                    I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Winter of 2011.
                    My first job out of college was at Intel in Oregon, where I worked as a Formal Verification Engineer on the Haswell/Broadwell
                    architecture, validating hardware virtualization and the Uncore System Agent. This eventually transitioned to a
                    Validation Engineer role on the Input/Output Memory Management Unit, a modular and scalable Soft-IP for VT-d and
                    SVM that is used internally in all Intel architectures ranging from mobile to HPC.

                    <br><br>

                    In 2015, I move to the Bay Area and transferred internally to Intel’s Server division. There, I was a
                    Design Engineer on Cannonlake Server and owned both Core Hard-IP integration and System Agent VT-d Design
                    using the IOMMU. With respect to Core HIP Integration, I coordinated a multi-site design and validation
                    team across the US, India, and Israel to insure that the CNX Core was properly validated and integrated on schedule.

                    <br><br>

                    In 2016, I decided to leave Intel and pursue other opportunities. I wanted to see what else was out
                    there, and to see what it was like working in a smaller, more agile environment. Hence, I am now working
                    in a stealth startup developing a product which targets both the IoT market and smaller companies without
                    the budget for full scale hardware design divisions. Having put on multiple hats within the company,
                    I have learned a lot and have been exposed to a lot more than I would have at Intel since joining.
                    I have basically owned the full front-end design stack, from architecture, design, and validation to
                    synthesis, timing, analog interfacing, backend interfacing, and FPGA prototyping. Though I definitely
                    do miss the support that a big company offers, I love having the freedom of tackling a design problem
                    without being burdened by bureaucracy.

                    <br><br>

                    Since moving to California, I decided to continue my education to broaden my perspective in the semiconductor
                    industry as well as learn more about IoT and software design. As such, I’ve enrolled in Stanford’s Honor’s
                    Coop Program, a part-time graduate program that allows me to pursue my Masters in Electrical Engineering while
                    still working full-time. I will be finished by the Spring of 2017, with a EE focus on Hardware and Software System Design.
