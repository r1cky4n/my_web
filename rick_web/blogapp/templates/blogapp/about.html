                <h2 class="section-heading">Welcome to My Website…</h2>

                <p>
                This blog is about the projects I’m working on in my spare time. I’ll try to
                document the steps that helped me get stuff working, and provide links to
                tutorials and tools that I found useful. The blog will primarily be
                focused on full-stack development, though I do have some machine learning and
                hardware design project ideas I want to pursue. Hopefully this site will be
                useful to others trying to get started on their own projects, and inspire me to
                continue hacking away in my free time.  
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">A Little Bit About Myself…</h2>

                <p>
                I’m Rick Yan - born in China, grew up in Texas, went to school in
                upstate New York, and now working in the Bay Area. I received my Bachelors at Cornell and finished my Masters at Stanford part-time, both in the field of EE with an emphasis in CS. 
                </p>

                <p>
                After getting my start at Intel, working as a verification and design engineer in their Silicon Design Groups, I decided to try something new and take on a larger role in a growing industry. Currently, I'm a HW/SW designer and architect at zGlue, an IoT startup building a 3D IC interposer solution for wearable and industrial IoT devices. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Working at a startup is a lot different compared to working at Intel, and there is definitely a lot more stress and responsibilities associated with it. However, I’m enjoying the challenge, and there is no shortage of opportunities to learn and innovate.  
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Some Closing Thoughts…</h2>

                <p>
                I think we are approaching a new era of technological advancement as compute becomes more pervasive and traditional forms of optimization are starting to lose their luster. Moore’s Law no longer appears as daunting as it was before to scrappy startups, and we are seeing a re-awakening of domain specific architectures and companies going fully vertical to created optimized solutions for specific problems. General computing really isn’t that interesting anymore, and is quickly becoming commoditized. Though Intel will still play a critical role in advancing the world’s technological capabilities, it is no longer the sole source of hardware innovation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                This thought use to fill me with dread when I was working at Intel. However, now that I have a better picture of the industry as a whole, I’m enthralled by the possibilities. This Wild West mentality is giving power back to the designers and architects building the HW/SW systems of the future. Since process gains will no longer be the sole driver of improvement, architectural innovations will again become critical in creating more efficient, more powerful technologies. Hopefully I get to play an interesting part in this new, exciting world.
